# Earth Impact Simulator
This is an adaptation of [my group final project for UCLA Fall 2023 CS 174A](https://github.com/md842/Earth-Impact-Simulator-CS-174A-Final-Project) containing improvements to functionality and compatibility as an embedded component of my personal website. 

This repository contains a JavaScript webpage that simulates an impact of a user-customizable meteor on Earth using the Tiny Graphics library. By altering the initial parameters set for the meteor's size and speed, the user can control the output of the simulation; the Earth's state post-collision ranges from unaffected to completely fragmented. Other features, such as changes to the meteor's texture, the selected camera view, the "Play Music" button, etc. do not affect the physics of the simulation.

## Running
This repository is intended to be an embedded component of my personal website and thus is not intended to be run as a standalone project. See the repository of the original project for instructions on running it as a standalone webpage.
